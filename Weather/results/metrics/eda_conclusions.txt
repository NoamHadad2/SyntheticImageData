📊 **Key Findings:**

1. **Class Imbalance**: The dataset has significant class imbalance.
   - Most common: Car (57,484 objects)
   - Least common: Person_sitting (444 objects)
   - Imbalance ratio: 129.5x
   → *Implication: May need class weighting or oversampling during training*

2. **Small Objects**: Significant portion of objects are small.
   - Small (<1% of image): 45,871 (56.5%)
   - Very small (<0.5% of image): 30,966 (38.2%)
   → *Implication: Model may struggle with small pedestrians/cyclists. Consider using larger input resolution.*

3. **Occlusion/Truncation**: Many objects have visibility challenges.
   - Heavily occluded (level ≥2): 20,598 (25.4%)
   - Significantly truncated (>50%): 6,058 (7.5%)
   → *Implication: Synthetic weather generation must preserve already-difficult objects carefully*

4. **Empty Images**: 0 images have no annotated objects.
   → *Implication: These images may still be useful for background/negative samples*

5. **Aspect Ratios**: Objects have diverse aspect ratios.
   - Cars: typically wider (aspect ratio > 1)
   - Pedestrians: typically taller (aspect ratio < 1)
   → *Implication: Anchor boxes should cover diverse ratios*

6. **Dataset Split**: Train/Val split appears balanced.
   - Train: 7481 images
   - Val: 7481 images
   → *Note: Test split will be created from train in notebook 03*
